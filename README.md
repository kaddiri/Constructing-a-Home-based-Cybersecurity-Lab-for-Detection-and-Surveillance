# Constructing-a-Home-based-Cybersecurity-Lab-for-Detection-and-Surveillance

# Abstract
The project outlines the creation of a cybersecurity homelab focused on detection and monitoring. It provides a practical environment for configuring, securing, and monitoring an IT infrastructure, enabling users to apply their skills in real-world scenarios. Components include pfSense firewall, Security Onion IDS, Kali Linux for attacks, Windows Server as a domain controller, Splunk for log management, and various Linux machines. The project emphasizes hands-on learning and safe experimentation in cybersecurity practices.

# What is a Homelab?
A Homelab is an environment meant to simulate enterprise components and configuration. The goal here is to understand the process of installing, configuring, maintaining and updating this entire infrastructure. We are building a virtualized Homelab as it is beginner friendly and easier to configure and spin up.

# Tools
Attacker - Kali Linux as an attack machine
Firewall - pfSense
IDS - SecurityOnion
SIEM - Splunk
Hypervisor - VMWare/Virtualbox
Domain Controller - Windows Active Directory
Vulnerable Machines - Ubuntu, Windows, DVWA, Vulnhub machines
